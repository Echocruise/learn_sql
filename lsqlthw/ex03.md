## exercise

```sql
INSERT INTO person (id, first_name,last_name,age)
  VALUES(0, 'Zed', 'Shaw', 37);

INSERT INTO pet (id, name, breed, age, dead)
  VALUES(0, 'Fluffy', 'Unicon',1000, 0);

INSERT INTO pet VALUES(1, 'Gigantor', 'Robot',1, 1);
```
  - 插入值的两种方式
  - INSERT INTO table_name **(columns)** VALUES (data)
  - INSERT INTO table_name  VALUES (data)
## study drills

1. Insert yourself and your pets (or imaginary pets like I have).
```sql
INSERT INTO person (id, first_name,last_name,age)
  VALUES(0, 'shikun', 'xia', 23);

INSERT INTO pet (id, name, breed, age, dead)
  VALUES(0, 'xiaobai', 'white',12, 0);
```
2. If you changed the database in the last exercise to not have the person_pet table then make a new database with that schema, and insert the same information into it.

3. Go back to the list of data types and take notes on what format you need for the different types. For example, how many ways can you write TEXT data.

## Portability Notes
 As I mentioned in the last exercise, database vendors tend to add lock-in to their platforms by extending or altering the data types used. They’ll subtly make their TEXT columns a little different here, or their DATETIME columns are called TIMESTAMP and take a different format. Watch out for this when you use a different database.
