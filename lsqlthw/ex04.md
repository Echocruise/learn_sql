## exercise

```sql
INSERT INTO person_pet(person_id,pet_id) VALUES (0,0);
INSERT INTO person_pet VALUES (0,0)
```

## study drills

1. Add the relationships for you and your pets.
2. Using this table, could a pet be owned by more than one person? Is that logically possible? What about the family dog? Wouldn’t everyone in the family technically own it?
  - 就现实逻辑来说，一个人可以有多条狗
  - 但多个人养1条狗，比较少见。一个家庭养一个狗，用数据表示的确很难。

3. Given the above, and given that you have an alternative design that puts the pet_id in the person table, which design is better for this situation?
