## exercise

```sql
CREATE TABLE person(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE pet(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  breed TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  dead INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE person_pet(
  person_id INTEGER,
  pet_id INTEGER
);

```
- sqlite3 ex02.db < ex02.sql
- sqlite3> .schema
- tables that have data are ”tables”, and tables that link tables together are called ”relations

## study drills
1. In these tables I made a 3rd relation table to link them. How would you get rid of this relation table person_pet and put that information right into person? What's the implication of this change?

2. If you can put one row into person_pet, can you put more than one? How would you record a crazy cat lady with 50 cats? Create another table for the cars people might own, and create its corresponding relation table

3.  Search for"sqlite3 datatypes"in your favorite search engine and go read the"Datatypes In SQLITE Version 3"document. Take notes on what types you can use and other things thatseem important We'll cover more later
  - [Datatypes In SQLite Version 3](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html)
  - NULL. The value is a NULL value.
  - INTEGER. The value is a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
  - REAL. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
  - TEXT. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
  - BLOB. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.
  -  Boolean Datatype
